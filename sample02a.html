                <h1>Tiger</h1>
                <p>
                     The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, most recognizable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange
                    fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard,
                    jaguar, and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and
                    bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous
                    areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous
                    to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.

<!--                         The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body.
                        Its pelage is dense and heavy, and colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white
                        ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes that are unique in each individual.[59][23]
                        Stripes are likely advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical
                        patterns of light and shade. [60][61] The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not
                        known why spotted patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids.
