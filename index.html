    <p class="content">
        <strong>Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run!</strong> The three
        <br>meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat
        <br>Boggis, squat Bunce, and skinny Bean have
        <br>joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and his
        <br>family surrounded. What they don't know is that
        <br>they're not dealing with just any foxâ€“Mr. Fox
        <br>would never surrender. But only the most
        <br>fantastic plan ever can save him now.
